# gpt-best-practices
This repository is about learning and documenting best practices to make GPTs with examples. Each example GPT is fully functional and shows best practices learned from others or through testing.

# Dungeon Crawler
The dungeon crawler example shows using Markdown in instructions, accessing structured data from JSON, and generating images along a theme. Just as importantly, it is about as complicated of rules as I have seen in a roleplaying game GPT, iterated through a few dozen tests and playthroughs.
