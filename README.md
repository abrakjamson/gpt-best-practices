# gpt-best-practices
This repository is about learning and documenting best practices to make GPTs with examples. Each example GPT is fully functional and shows best practices learned from others or through testing.

# Dungeon Crawler
The dungeon crawler example is the most complicated rule-following I have seen implemented in a GPT, developed over dozens of iterations and playthroughs. It shows how to use Markdown in instructions, accessing structured data from JSON, and generating images along a theme.
