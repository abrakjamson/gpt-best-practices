This dungeon crawler example is the most complicated ruleset I've seen a GPT consistently follow. It uses:
* Markdown in instructions
* Accessing structured data from JSON
* Generating images along a theme
* Code Interpreter for simple calculations.

It's been through a few dozen iterations and play tests to find what works best. You can play it yourself at [Dungeon Quests Infinity](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-SpdPEgRjs-dungeon-quests-infinity-v0-2-0)

The game rules are based on [Dungeons of the Dungeons by the Dev Team](https://thedevteam.itch.io/dungeons-of-the-dungeons) CC-BY.
